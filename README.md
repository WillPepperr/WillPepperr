<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Will! 👋<br/>Data Analyst</h1>

I’m a data analyst with a background in economics, currently pursuing an MS in Management Information Systems at the University of Illinois Springfield. I focus on turning complex data into clear, actionable insights that support strategic decisions, using analysis and visualization to uncover trends. I’m also passionate about programming—exploring data science, machine learning, game development, and building practical tools. You can see some of my completed projects below!

## Data Analytics Reporting Projects
📦 [**Retail Invoice Automation Analysis**](https://github.com/WillPepperr/retail-invoice-automation-analysis) — Quantifying Operational Labor Savings (SQL, Snowflake, Power BI)

- Evaluates the financial and operational impact of automating invoice receiving across 290 grocery retail locations, identifying $5.7M in achievable annual labor savings.
- Analyzes invoice-level labor costs (over 4M entries) by vendor, category, and region to determine high-impact adoption priorities and rollout thresholds.
- Supports executive decision-making with scenario modeling, regional prioritization, and implementation strategies to assess ROI feasibility and risk.

📊 [**Ecommerce Sales Analysis**](https://github.com/WillPepperr/eccomerce-sales-analysis) — Supporting Marketing Decision Making (Excel, PowerBI, Python)

- Analyzes sales performance to provide the marketing team with actionable insights for refining campaigns and improving ROI.  
- Identifies trends in customer purchasing behavior, highlights high-value product opportunities, and pinpoints seasonal sales challenges.  
- Translates complex data into targeted strategies, enabling the team to adjust promotions, loyalty programs, and channel investments for maximum impact.

## Technical Projects
⛳ [**Golf Data Analysis Tool**](https://github.com/WillPepperr/data-analysis-tool-for-golfers) — Interactive Excel Tool for Golf Performance (Excel, VBA)

- Allows users to enter, store, and visualize golf performance data efficiently.  
- Includes a database of over 17,000 courses, a VBA-powered entry form, and dashboards built with PivotTables and PivotCharts.  
- Users can quickly add results, refresh the data, and track performance over time with interactive visuals.

🧠  [**AI Blackjack**](https://github.com/WillPepperr/reinforcement-deep-neural-network) — Deep Reinforcement Learning with PyTorch

- Builds an AI agent that learns optimal Blackjack strategy using deep reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo–generated training data.
- Includes a realistic simulated environment, custom card‐dataset generator for consistent model inputs, and benchmarking tools to evaluate performance across trained models.
- Supports GPU-accelerated training and multithreaded model generation. Best achieved result: ~1% loss versus the ~0.5% theoretical optimum for the ruleset.

🃏 [**Realistic Blackjack Simulation**](https://github.com/WillPepperr/python-blackjack) — Object-Oriented Python Game

- A command-line Blackjack game simulating real gameplay with accurate rules and scoring.  
- Uses structured data and object-oriented design to manage the deck, player hands, and game outcomes.  
- Demonstrates careful organization of information and logic to track and update game state in real time.
